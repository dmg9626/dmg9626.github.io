For my next map, I wanted to make something more expansive and intricate, a traditional map rather than an artistic statement. I spent some time replaying the original DOOM games, taking a closer look at how id Software designed their levels. As I started blocking out my level, I also took [John Romero's rules of level design](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/John_Romero#Design_rules) to heart, most notably the following:

> - Conscious use of contrast everywhere in a level between light and dark areas, cramped and open areas
> - Making sure that if a player could see outside that they should be able to somehow get there
> - Being strict about designing several secret areas on every level
> - Making my levels flow so the player will revisit areas several times so they will better understand the 3D space of the level
> - Creating easily recognizable landmarks in several places for easier navigation
