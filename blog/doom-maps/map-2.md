For my next map, I wanted to make something more expansive and intricate, a traditional map rather than an artistic statement. 

I ended up spending much, much more time on this map than I anticipated. I started working on the map in early February, and 6 months (and a global catastrophe) later I'm finally calling it complete! This is just one of several attempts to write this development blog: after weeks of polish, I'd write about the process and take screenshots of the map before finding something I could improve upon, and the cycle would continue.

### The Mentality
-----

As COVID-19 wreaked Hell on Earth, I found comfort creating my own Hell in DOOM. I spent hours and hours, and my parents grew concerned about my caffiene-fueled level design benders.

The obsession stemmed in part from my interest in the archaic game engine and the experimental alchemy of level design. But above all, I was hooked by the brooding nature of DOOM's atmostphere. Watching the world burn made me grow angry. America shit the bed in its response to the pandemic, and obscene police brutality grew vanilla, forming yet another parallel to Nazi Germany. Our social consciousness has, in a nationalist fever dream, forgotten that we are operating concentration camps on American soil. 

Anyway, happy good thoughts. Let's talk about the map!

### The Process
------

Before doing anything, I had to learn from the best. So I spent some time replaying the original DOOM games, taking a closer look at how id Software designed their levels.

After blasting through DOOM I and II, I took [John Romero's rules of level design](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/John_Romero#Design_rules) to heart, most notably the following:

> - Conscious use of contrast everywhere in a level between light and dark areas, cramped and open areas
> - Making sure that if a player could see outside that they should be able to somehow get there
> - Being strict about designing several secret areas on every level
> - Making my levels flow so the player will revisit areas several times so they will better understand the 3D space of the level
> - Creating easily recognizable landmarks in several places for easier navigation

The rule that resonated most for me was **contrast**: I wanted to create a more varied map, combining large open spaces with claustrophobic, dark corridors. And, of course, I had to take advantage of DOOM's technical feat: vertical architecture.

<div class="row">
  <!-- Plaza -->
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <a href="/assets/images/blog/doom-maps/map2/plaza/plaza.png" target="_blank">
      <img src="/assets/images/blog/doom-maps/map2/plaza/plaza.png" class="blog rounded mx-auto d-block" width="100%" height="auto">
    </a>
  </div>

    </a>
  </div>
</div>

When I'm making things, I often fall into the trap of perfecting the prototype. So I made an effort to avoid this, carving out the map in big rough chunks: make geometry first, ask questions later. It was like an architectural version of that game you'd play in art class as a kid: draw a big scribbly line on your paper, then try and make it into a coherent picture.

Through frequent iteration, I gained a better understanding of the engine's limitations and how to work around them. I'd take breaks to play community megawads, like 
[Back to Saturn X](https://www.moddb.com/mods/back-to-saturn-x) or 
[Resurgence](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/66084-resurgence-boom-compatible-megawad-final-version-released-idgames-link-up/). While ripping and tearing through the countless levels, I picked up on the mappers' tricks and techniques to create an immersive space.
