***Note:** The [A4Engine game engine](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~santi/teaching/2017/CS387/PCG/){:target="_blank"} and [extended TMX map format](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~santi/teaching/2017/CS387/PCG/A4Reference2.3.html){:target="_blank"}, both developed by Prof. Santiago Ontañón, were used for playing the maps generated by my program. Further documentation can be found [here](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~santi/teaching/2017/CS387/PCG/A4Reference2.3.html){:target="_blank"}.*

This project was [another assignment](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~santi/teaching/2017/CS387/PCG/projectA4PCGv2.3.html){:target="_blank"} from my Game AI course: 

> Implement a procedural map generator that creates playable maps for the A4Engine. 
> It can generate dungeons, outdoors maps (with grass, rivers, trees, rocks, paths, etc.), or interiors - it's up to you.
> It must adhere to the [TMX map format](http://doc.mapeditor.org/en/stable/reference/tmx-map-format/){:target="_blank"}.

Most of my friends generated dungeons with their solutions, using the Kruskal algorithm to generate maze-like environments (this approach was suggested by the professor). I wanted to try something different, so I went about generating a outdoor landscape environment.

My plan was to generate a 2D heightmap - a grid of numbers between 0 and 1 that represent the height at each tile. Once I could generate that that, I'd determine some altitude to be the water level; every tile with a height above that level would be land, and everything below would be water. I wasn't sure what would come next, but I knew that'd be enough to start generating some very basic environments.

### Step 1: Generate the Heightmap

To be clear, I didn't plan on having any actual verticality in the maps generated! I was just combining a heightmap and a water level to create an insteresting arrangement of land and water.

##### Take something like this...

##### ...and turn it into something like this:

*Note: my maps are generated at a much lower resolution - think Final Fantasy or Pokemon*

I used the [diamond-square algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond-square_algorithm){:target="_blank"} to generate the heightmaps. It starts with intial height values in the corners and iteratively performs "Diamond" and "Square" averaging operations, forming increasingly granular diamonds/squares from the populated grid points until all points have been filled in. Each Diamond and Square operation applies a bit of "noise" so we don't get boring, perfectly-smooth maps.

This limited me to square-shaped maps, but I didn't have a problem with that.

I'd start with a heightmap with preset corner values:

```
0.22    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.09

0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00

0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00

0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00

0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00

0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00

0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00

0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00

0.32    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00    0.60
```

And the diamond-square algorithm populates the rest of the map:

```
0.22    0.24    0.24    0.24    0.22    0.21    0.19    0.16    0.09

0.25    0.26    0.22    0.24    0.21    0.23    0.18    0.20    0.18

0.28    0.23    0.13    0.17    0.12    0.16    0.11    0.21    0.24

0.29    0.25    0.16    0.17    0.14    0.17    0.17    0.26    0.29

0.32    0.24    0.11    0.14    0.09    0.15    0.11    0.27    0.36

0.31    0.27    0.18    0.21    0.16    0.24    0.21    0.34    0.40

0.32    0.25    0.12    0.18    0.11    0.20    0.15    0.36    0.48

0.31    0.28    0.26    0.26    0.28    0.30    0.35    0.43    0.51

0.32    0.33    0.36    0.36    0.43    0.42    0.49    0.51    0.60
```

This was nice because I could control the types of maps being generated by specifying certain corner values. For example, if I want a valley running from the top-right to the bottom-left of the map, I'd set low values in those corners, and high values in the top-left/bottom-right corners.
