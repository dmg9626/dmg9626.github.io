***Note:** The A4Engine game engine and extended TMX map format, developed by Prof. Santiago Onta침칩n, were used for playing the maps generated by my program. You should (hopefully) be able to access it [here](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~santi/teaching/2017/CS387/PCG/){:target="_blank"} or [here](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~eb452/teaching/CS387-w20/PCG/){:target="_blank"}* Further documentation can be found [here](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~santi/teaching/2017/CS387/PCG/A4Reference2.3.html){:target=_blank"}.

This project was [another assignment](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~santi/teaching/2017/CS387/PCG/projectA4PCGv2.3.html){:target="_blank"} from my Game AI course: 

> Implement a procedural map generator that creates playable maps for the A4Engine. 
> It can generate dungeons, outdoors maps (with grass, rivers, trees, rocks, paths, etc.), or interiors - it's up to you.

It must adhere to the [TMX map format](http://doc.mapeditor.org/en/stable/reference/tmx-map-format/){:target="_blank"}, as well as the [extended format](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~santi/teaching/2017/CS387/PCG/A4Reference2.3.html){:target=_blank"} developed by Santiago Onta침칩n.
