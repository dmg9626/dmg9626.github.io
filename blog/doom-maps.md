This is something I've always wanted to do. 

DOOM is the seminal, genre-defining first-person shooter developed by iD Software in 1993. To me, it's a testament to how games should be made: with a tightly-knit team, active collaboration between engineers and designers, and focus on core pillars of gameplay. To others, it's an ongoing challenge to get it running on obscure devices like [ATMs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PW5ELKTivbE) and [printers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLHx3vO7KJM). But to the largest and oldest modding community of all time, it's an undying platform for creating sprawling mapsets like [Back to Saturn X](https://www.moddb.com/mods/back-to-saturn-x), and experimental games like this [Sonic racing mod built from a platformer mod of DOOM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_QMNNKe75Q).

Today I'm happy to join that community by releasing my own maps for DOOM II.

My start in Doom mapping came from an interesting assignment prompt in my Experimental Games course:

> Using an existing game as a base, create "game art" that makes a statement about the games industry.<br>
> It can be a mod, something created in a game's level editor, etc. as long as you build some sort of experience from an existing game.

At first I was stumped. We'd learned in class about the concept of "game art", artistic experiences created using games as a toolset for communicating some message. Kind of like [photobashing](https://conceptartempire.com/photobashing/) but with video games. Then our professor showed two examples that really grabbed me: a DOOM WAD set in an art museum where you shoot snobby prominent art critics, and an abstract Wolfenstein 3D mod that replaced all textures/sprites with disorienting black/white pixelation.

That week I'd been reading about the [binary-space-partitioning](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/c496/61c65c1780053dcc1ccd71abec5f244af2c9.pdf) method used by John Carmack to render 3D environments in DOOM. I was interested in the architectural limitations imposed by the game engine, and how level designers overcame them with creative solutions. This seemed like a wonderful opportunity to ~~shoehorn my personal interests into another assignment~~ make something interesting in an obscure medium!

It took quite some time to figure out what I was doing here.
