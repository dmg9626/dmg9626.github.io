This is something I've always wanted to do. 

DOOM is the seminal, genre-defining first-person shooter developed by iD Software in 1993. To me, it's a testament to how games should be made: with a tightly-knit team, active collaboration between engineers and designers, and focus on core pillars of gameplay. To others, it's an ongoing challenge to get it running on obscure devices like [ATMs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PW5ELKTivbE) and [printers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLHx3vO7KJM). But to the largest and oldest modding community of all time, it's an undying platform for creating sprawling mapsets like [Back to Saturn X](https://www.moddb.com/mods/back-to-saturn-x), and experimental games like this [Sonic racing mod built from a platformer mod of DOOM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_QMNNKe75Q).

Today I'm happy to join that community by releasing my own maps for DOOM II.
