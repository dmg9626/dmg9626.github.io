*(Artistic representation)*

Thomas the Bluesmobile is a project I worked on for ANIM 211 (Animation I). The assignment was to take a 30-second scene from a movie and recreate it shot-for-shot, mimicking the cinematography, environment, and actors; the catch is I had to replace the actors/environment with inanimate objects, in a way that the scene still made some coherent sense.

Initially I struggled to wrap my head around this assignment. I started with a different concept: the 
[cop chase scene from the Blues Brothers movie](https://youtu.be/LMagP52BWG8?t=44){:target="_blank"}, 
but instead of the Blues Brothers in their Bluesmobile, it'd be OJ Simpson escaping in the white Bronco. I drafted up a rough storyboard of that idea, which you can see here:

My professor enjoyed the idea but said I had to make my changes more drastic. He suggested I replace OJ with a box of orange juice, have it set in a kitchen or something, and brainstorm from there. I wasn't really into that, but eventually I settled on my final concept: the [bridge jump scene](https://youtu.be/QTOg4aYGtdY?t=7){:target="_blank"} from the same movie, but recreated in a kid's bedroom with Thomas the Train and Devious Diesel on toy train tracks. I was picturing a kid that watched the movie with his dad or something, and now he's playing with his toy trains to recreate the scene in his imagination.

I'm not sure why I struggled with the concept for this assignment at first; I guess animating an in-animate thing to represent something animate doesn't really make sense to me, but limitations give way to creative solutions.

I went back to the (literal) drawing board and created another storyboard animatic (shown above) for this revised concept, which set me behind schedule a bit.

Our first deliverable was a greybox pass of each shot in the scene. I didn't manage to block out all the scenes, but I did get a lot of the modeling work done on Thomas and Diesel.

Next was the full material pass. I focused my efforts here on fleshing out the models and materials for everything in the scene, so that I'd have time to set up and render all my shots the following week. At this point I was quickly aborting the traditional animation pipeline (properly setting up all shots, then taking the beauty pass with materials/lights/remodeling) - Drexel's 10-week quarters really don't accommodate that workflow.

*(Fun Fact: You can see here is where I realized that I mixed up the positions of Thomas and Diesel. Glad I fixed that before the final cut!)*

I had to make the most of my time, setting batches of renders to process on my desktop overnight (the loud GPU fans made sleeping rough). During weeks 9 and 10 you could find me in the animation labs, hopping from computer-to-computer kicking off renders around the clock. Spreading the workload across multiple computers was the only way to meet the deadlines. The soundtrack for the week was Flying Lotus:

And this is the final cut! 

Compared to the original scene:

I haven't tried adding in the audio from the original scene yet, but so far I'm very proud of what I came out with. This was an interesting look into the aniamtion pipeline, and it's always nice to understand a new facet of how things are made. I have a newfound appreciation for the work done by my 3D colleagues going forward!
