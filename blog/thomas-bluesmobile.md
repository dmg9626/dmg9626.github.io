*(I recommend you start reading this post before watching the animation, to give it some context)*

So this is a project I worked on for ANIM 211 (Animation I). The assignment was to take a scene from a movie and recreate it; the catch is I had to replace the actors/environment with inanimate objects, in a way that the scene still made some coherent sense.

Initially I struggled to wrap my head around this assignment. I started with a different concept: the 
[cop chase scene from the Blues Brothers movie](https://youtu.be/LMagP52BWG8?t=44){:target="_blank"}, 
but instead of the Blues Brothers in their Bluesmobile, it'd be OJ Simpson escaping in the white Bronco. I drafted up a rough storyboard of that idea, which you can see here:

My professor enjoyed the idea but said I had to make my changes more drastic. He suggested I replace OJ with a box of orange juice, have it set in a kitchen or something, and brainstorm from there. I wasn't really into that idea, but eventually I settled on my final idea: the [bridge jump scene](https://youtu.be/QTOg4aYGtdY?t=7){:target="_blank"} from the same movie, but recreated in a kid's bedroom with Thomas the Train and Devious Diesel on toy train tracks.

I went back to the drawing board and created a new storyboard animatic. My professor loved the idea and gave me the greenlight to start working in Maya.
