## Overview

[Holy Tester](/games/holy-tester) is a procedurally-generated roguelike dungeon crawler developed in my Games Workshop II class. It was produced over the course of 20 weeks, 10 of which I spent working on [It's Haunt Time](/games/its-haunt-time) before switching teams. I was challenged with jumping into an existing codebase, redesigning their enemy AI to be more robust while accommodating new enemy types.
