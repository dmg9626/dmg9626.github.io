## Overview

[Holy Tester](/games/holy-tester) is a procedurally-generated roguelike dungeon crawler developed in my Games Workshop II class. It was produced over the course of 20 weeks, 10 of which I spent working on [It's Haunt Time](/games/its-haunt-time) before switching teams. I was challenged with jumping into an existing codebase, redesigning their enemy AI to be more robust while accommodating new enemy types. 

I learned a lot throughout development, mainly that I love game AI programming! I also strived to make my tools easy to use for my teammates (both coders and designers), while leveraging relevant design patterns to allow frequent code reuse. This proved especially helpful when designing a variety of enemies, as their behaviors often had plenty of overlap; for example, the same movement code was utilized for nearly all enemies. Much of what I learned came from messing around on my own, but I also looked to this wonderful AI textbook ([Artificial Intelligence for Games](https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Games-Ian-Millington/dp/0123747317){:target="_blank"}) for resources and guidance.
