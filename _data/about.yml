        This game had a surprisingly compelling narrative (even for Rockstar's standards).
        John Marston's actions (and those around him) paint a futile struggle to
        "do the right thing."

        This is, hands-down, the best narrative experience I've ever had in a game. 
        Don't spoil it by reading reviews - just jump in blind and enjoy the ride.

        This game does a stellar job of delivering narrative through the environment.
        Also the soundtrack is sublime, great for listening during work or study.

        A fantastic homage to System Shock. I've just finished the main game
        and I'm excited to dive into the Mooncrash expansion.

        My favorite show made a game, and it's actually good! The humour is spot on
        with the show, and it's helped tide me over until the next season premieres.

        Don't be misled by the "tactical lingerie" - it's a fantastic sci-fi
        about sociopolitical manipulation through social media (an advanced subject
        considering its 2002 debut).

        This game has helped me survive the Hell on Earth that is 2020. It's one of very few games I'll call a 10/10,
        and it spawned an undying map making community that I'm proud to be a part of.
