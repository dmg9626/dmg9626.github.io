        This game had a surprisingly compelling narrative (even for Rockstar's standards).
        John Marston's actions (and those around him) paint a futile struggle to
        "do the right thing."

        This is, hands-down, the best narrative experience I've ever had in a game. 
        Don't spoil it by reading reviews - just jump in blind and enjoy the ride.

        This game does a stellar job of delivering narrative through the environment.
        Also the soundtrack is sublime, great for listening during work or study.

        A fantastic homage to System Shock. I've just finished the main game
        and I'm excited to dive into the Mooncrash expansion.

        Don't be misled by the "tactical lingerie" - it's a fantastic sci-fi
        about sociopolitical manipulation through social media (an advanced subject
        considering its 2002 debut).

        My favorite show made a game, and it's actually good! The humour is spot on
        with the show and I'm loving every second of it.
