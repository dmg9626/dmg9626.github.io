<h3>Description</h3>
<p><i>It's Haunt Time!</i> is a cute spook-em-up puzzle game designed for mobile devices. You play as Hatto, a ghost trying his best to win the Scare Championships. Help Hatto scare the human; you'll have to navigate his house, interacting with the environment to overcome ephemeral-repelling obstacles like fans, salt, and even a scary cat. Do your best and go for the gold!</p>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>This game was developed in our Games Workshop class as a vertical-slice prototype, with more levels/features planned for the future. As lead programmer, I created a flexible system for scripting the interactable objects in the game, as well as setting up the Unity -> Android/WebGL build pipeline and touch controls. I applied what I learned about software design patterns and ended up developing a very clean, robust codebase that I'd consider using in future projects.</p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges in this game was designing intuitive mechanics and interactions for the player. We strived to avoid falling back on tutorials to direct the player; instead, we wanted the gameplay to teach the player how to play.</p>
