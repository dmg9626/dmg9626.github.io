### Description

Surface Tension is a puzzle platform game that relies on manipulating the properties of surfaces to traverse obstacles. The player can make a surface bouncy to jump up high, or coat it in a slick sheet of ice to quickly slide across the surface. These surfaces are used to solve puzzles, like bouncing a block across a bouncy surface to get it up a ledge. Things get interesting when you use these surface types in tandem - often solutions require both speed and height. The gameplay consists of fast-paced maneuvers woven with restful periods of planning; levels challenge the player to think creatively, quickly, or even both at once.

### Background

This game was developed for the course GMAP 260 (Overview of Computer Gaming) with a team of five, including myself. It was a great experience in applying the object-oriented principles and game programming patterns I've picked up since my previous projects. The codebase we ended up with was far more structured than any of our previous projects - I really pushed to keep our code organized (flexible, scalable, reusable, and functional), finding myself rewriting sections of code multiple times. I'm very proud of the final result; even after the course ended I've found myself adding functionality and improving the code.
