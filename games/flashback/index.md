### Description

Flashback is a game developed for [Brackeys Game Jam 2020.2](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-4) by myself, [Wills Martin](https://willsmartin.itch.io/), and [Harrison Brietling](http://harrisonbrietling.com/). The theme of the jam was REWIND, so we set out to make a game with that concept in mind.

In Flashback, the player must complete levels by making use of their Rewind ability, which turns back time and restores the level to its starting state. This also spawns an "Echo," a copy of the player that repeats their previous actions. The gameplay revolves around planning a sequence of moves, often across multiple Rewinds, to complete each level.

### Jam Results

I'm proud to say that, out of nearly 2000 submissions, our game was ranked 11th overall! We did even better in some of the individual categories, as you can see below:

While I went into this jam with the mindset of "fuck winning, just make something fun," I'm thrilled that our little game did so well! My past experience with hackathons has given me a cynical outlook on the competitive nature of rankings, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't stoked to see our game near the top of the list.

If I have time in the future, I'd like to iterate on it some more - especially in the form of new levels. I know our puzzle mechanics can be combined and expanded upon beyond the 9 levels we created.
