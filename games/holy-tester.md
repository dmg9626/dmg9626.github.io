<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
The Holy Grail has been shattered into mere fragments, breaking an ancient seal and unleashing minions of hell! Each fragment has reformed into its own grail, manifesting the Holy Grail's true power with various abilities. The Everfrost Grail lets you throw ice spears at your enemies, while the Mech Grail shoots a wide spread of gears.
</p>

<p>
You'll need these grails to contend with a variety of fearsome foes. The Hellbat darts around the room and spits fireballs, while the Taurush charges at you head-on with a stun attack. Choose your grails wisely, as no playthrough is quite the same: explore a randomly-generated dungeon to assemble the shattered Holy Grail!

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>
This game was developed in our Games Workshop II class as a moderately fleshed out game prototype.
</p> 

<p>
After being lead programmer for our last project, <a href="its-haunt-time/">Its Haunt Time!</a>, I was happy to let someone else lead for this game. I focused on the enemy AI programming and developed a robust Tactic system that gave each enemy unique behaviors. This allowed me to design enemies using the same basic components for movement/attacking, while giving them Tactics that delegated instructions to those components.
</p>

<p>
I made sure to leverage any useful programming patterns I'd learned in Software Design. I'm not sure if it strictly followed any established design pattern, but it seems to make use of the Template and Strategy Patterns.
</p>

<p>
Working on this project led me to discover how much I love AI programming. I dove into a dusty textbook in the Computer Science building, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Artificial-Intelligence-Games-Ian-Millington/dp/0123747317">Artificial Intelligence for Games</a>, and learned about all kinds of ways to develop intelligent behaviors. I recognized many techniques as things I'd discovered on my own (obviously more refined by the writers), and learned much more about behaviors I couldn't imagine designing on my own. Through reading and experimentation, the biggest lesson in AI programming I learned is that complex behaviors are best designed as a combinationation of simpler behaviors.
