<h3>Description</h3>
<p>test</p>

<hr>

<h3>Background</h3>
<p>This game was developed in our Games Workshop II class as a vertical-slice prototype, with more levels/features planned for the future.</p> 

<p>As lead programmer, I created a flexible system for scripting the interactable objects in the game, as well as setting up the Unity -> Android/WebGL build pipeline and touch controls. I applied what I learned about software design patterns and ended up developing a very clean, robust codebase that I'd consider using in future projects.</p>

<p>One of the biggest challenges we faced was making the game mechanics feel intuitive to the player. We strived to avoid falling back on tutorials to direct the player; our goal was to let the gameplay teach the player.</p>
