<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
The Holy Grail has been shattered into mere fragments, breaking an ancient seal and unleashing minions of hell! Each fragment has reformed into its own grail, manifesting the Holy Grail's true power with various abilities. The Everfrost Grail lets you throw ice spears at your enemies, while the Mech Grail shoots a wide spread of gears.
</p>

<p>
You'll need these grails to contend with a variety of fearsome foes. The Hellbat darts around the room and spits fireballs, while the Taurush charges at you head-on with a stun attack. Choose your grails wisely, as no playthrough is quite the same: explore a randomly-generated dungeon to assemble the shattered Holy Grail!
