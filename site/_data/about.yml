        This game does a stellar job of delivering narrative through the environment.

        A fantastic homage to System Shock. I've just finished the main game
        and I'm excited to dive into the Mooncrash expansion.

        Don't be misled by the "tactical lingerie" - it's a fantastic sci-fi
        about sociopolitical manipulation through social media (an advanced subject

        I just remembered my favorite show made a game. The humour is spot on
        with the show and I'm loving every second of it.
